# WEATHERPY
Analysing weather in about 500+ random cities across the world of varying distance from the equator by using Python script and generating maps to visualize correlations. All this was achieved Using Python library- Citypy, and the OpenWeatherMap API.

Observable Trends:
*It is evident from the maps that there is absolutely no correlation between the latitude and the cloud cover.
*There seems to be a relatively strong correlation between latitude and temperature. As the latitudes go high, the temperature dips. It is inversely proprtional to the temperature.
*Another observation is the concentration of cities in the northern hemisphere.
